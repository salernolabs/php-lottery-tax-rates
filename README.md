# salernolabs/php-us-tax-rates

![Travis Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/salernolabs/php-us-tax-rates.svg?branch=master)

A light-weight, no-cruft PHP library that includes lottery tax rates for use in the 
[I'm In It app](https://www.iminitapp.com) service. The main purpose is to open source 
the tax rates used by [I'm In It app](https://www.iminitapp.com) but you may use this 
wherever it may help you out.

These tax rates update frequently and we're not always on top of them. Pull requests are 
always welcome as long as they include a source for the information!

They also only include states where the mega lotteries are currently in play. If you need 
this library for something else that also requires the other states, cut a PR!

## Use in your project

Feel free to use this library in your project, fork it, PR back, etc.
